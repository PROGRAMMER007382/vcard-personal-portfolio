About me

I'm a first year student at Partido State University. I am a creative tech with a passion for music. By day, I am studying programming, tackling complex codes and innovative ideas. But when the sun sets, my fingers dance across guitar strings and piano keys, crafting soothing melodies. My blend of artistic talent and technical skill makes you a true Renaissance individual, driven by curiosity and creativity.
